// Abstract Classes and Members
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

// Abstract modifier states that a class or a member misses implementation. 
// We use abstract members when it doesn’t make sense to implement them in a base class. 
// For example, the concept of drawing a shape is too abstract. 
// We don’t know how to draw a shape. This needs to be implemented in the derived classes.
