// Terms which are used

// - Presentation (Example: PostView).
// - Business Logic / Domain (Example: Post).
// - Data Access / Persistence (Example: PostRepository).



// Anatomy of a Class
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// Data (Represented by fields).
// Behavior (Represented by methods / functions).
// Class members: 
// Instance member - Accessible from an object.
// Static member - Accessible from the Class.
// Shouldn't declare fields with the public, it maybe get and set helps with this.



// Static member : Anatomy of a Class
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// To represent concepts that are singleton.
// For example "Console.WriteLine();"
// Used where you only want one instance of the concept in the memory.



// Constructors : Anatomy of a Class
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// This is a method of a class that is called when an instance of a class is created.
// Purpose is to put an instance in an early state.
// They don't have return types.


// Object
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// Object is an instance of a class.


// Naming conventions
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// For Classes use Pascal Case.
// Use Camel Case for the naming of methods. 



// Method overloading
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// Overloading means having a method of the same name but with different signatures.
// Essentially that take different paremeters.
// This is to make initialiseation easier, sometimes we may know only the name for example, or the names and the age etc.
// Essentailly to handle different types of data we may have.



// Method signature
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// This is identified by the method return type, name and types and numbers of it's parameters.





// Integers
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// The default value of an integer is 0.


// Strings
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// The default value of a string is null.


// Reference types
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// The default value of a reference type is null.
